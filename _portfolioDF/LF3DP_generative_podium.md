## Background

* **Microfluidic mixing** aims to achieve thorough and rapid mixing of multiple fluid samples on a microscale level
  * The small size of the flow channels in these mixers increases the surface to volume ratio when compared to macro-scale mixers, making these devices useful in many applications
  * These devices have a considerable impact on the fields of _biomedical diagnostics and drug development_ as well as the _food and chemical industries_
  * Specific applications of microfluidic mixing include:
