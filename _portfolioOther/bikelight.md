## Problem

* Biking at night can be dangerous since it is difficult for pedestrians and motorists to see when bicyclists are signaling for turns. 
* As someone who lived off-campus and had to regularly bike home at night after long days on campus, this was a problem I faced regularly.

## Solution 
* The solution I developed was the BikeLight: an automated LED signaling system for bikers that includes a hand-mounted turn signal component and a brake light component on the rear of the bike. 
* For the hand-mounted component, an accelerometer senses the position of the bicyclistâ€™s hand and the BikeLight displays an arrow in the direction the bike is going to turn based on traditional turning hand signals. 
* For the rear bike-mounted component, the rear brake light blinks when the bicycle is slowing down and emits light continuously when the bike is fully stopped.
