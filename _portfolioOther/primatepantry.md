## Problem

* The Nashville Zoo is home to two types of primates, white cheeked gibbons and siamangs, which are both endangered lesser apes highly motivated by food
* In the wild, these animals forage for fruits and leaves throughout the day in their natural habitat
* However, at the Nashville Zoo, they are placed on an island exhibit from 9am until 4pm, when they are brought back to their night house
  * As a result, the primates are given their entire diet for the day at 9a
  * This means that they tend to eat too quickly and exhibit some unnatural behaviors because they are bored and don’t have to forage for food
* To solve this problem, our sponsors at the zoo asked us to create a series of devices that will help slow down the primates’ eating behaviors and provide enrichment by more closely mimicking their natural feeding habits in this zoo environment

## Design Requirements
### Enrichment

* The device(s) should **mentally stimulate the primates** in one or more ways
* This means integrating some sort of puzzle or spreading system, noting that enrichment can be fulfilled by the primates scavenging for their food
* The enrichment provided should be more complex than previous processes used by the Nashville Zoo

### Food Spreading

* The device(s) should ideally **spread food over as large an area as possible**
* The spreading of food is considered a form of enrichment since it forces the primates to scavenge for food, slowing down their eating habits

### Timing

* As previously mentioned, the primates tend to eat their food too quickly and exhibit unnatural behaviors as a result from being bored
* Current feeding devices used by the zoo are not able to delay the release of food at all
* Our device should **delay the release of food** as much as possible, ideally within the range of 9am-12pm

### Robustness

* The gibbons and siamangs are considered Class I animals, meaning they are considered inherently dangerous to humans
* As a result, it is critical that any devices built must be **safe and robust** to withstand both the elements and the force of the primates
* Some of these considerations include:
  * Robustness against weather conditions
  * **No electronic components of any kind**
  * Use of materials that are food & animal friendly
  * Able to withstand intense interaction with strong primates

## Solutions
### Puzzle Feeders

* Two puzzle feeders were developed to focus on enrichment: one with rings, one with a collar
* Each feeder has an inner body with three holes in it and an outer component that obscures these holes in some way
  * To remove the food, the inner and outer components must be manipulated, encouraging the primates to engage with the device more than current zoo feeders
* An acrylic shelf was placed halfway up the inside of the body to ensure that both the top and bottom halves of the feeder had food
  * This ensured that the primates were forced to interact with both halves of the device instead of just reaching into a single hole to access the food



### Timed Ice Feeder

* This device focuses on delaying the release of food using a unique ice timer solution
* An acrylic shelf and 3D printed collar hold a block of ice in place halfway up the food storage component
  * The food (small chunks of fruit, Cheerios, nuts, etc.) is stored behind the ice stopper
  * Over a few hours, the ice melts, releasing the food into a 3D printed endcap
* This forces the primates to forage for the food later in the day

#### Ice Mold
* In order for the ice to fit snugly within the 3 inch PVC body, custom ice molds were created to make 3 inch diameter blocks of ice
* A custom 2-part mold was designed and 3D printed to cast silicone into the shape of the ice mold

### Lever Feeder

* Our final device focuses on using the destructive nature of the primates for food spreading
* The primates swing a lever up and down where it hits an internal mesh food bag
  * Each time it is hit, the bag releases a small amount of food out of the top grate
  * This grate is a 3D printed screw cap to allow the food bag to be removable
