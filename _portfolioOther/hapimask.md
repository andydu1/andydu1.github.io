## Problem

* After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks became a necessity for controlling the spread of viral particles and maintaining public safety. 
* This new standard significantly **minimized the quality of personal interactions** between mask wearers
* Research suggests that when portions of a face are obscured, people **confuse social judgments** related to the face (i.e., if the face looks attractive, approachable, trustworthy, intelligent), have **difficulty discerning feelings** and overall mood, and rate those faces as being **less happy**. 
* These studies also suggest that covering the mouth and cheeks via mask wearing will significantly alter and decrease the quality of human social interaction.

## Solution 
* To solve this issue, a group of friends and I developed HapiMask, a unique mask solution that **enhances the quality of social interaction** without compromising the safety of mask wearers and those around them. 
* Our mask prototype used an **electromyography (EMG) sensor** placed on the cheek of the mask wearer to detect when the user smiled and then **emitted a soft LED glow** in response. 
* An Arduino Lilypad, conductive thread, and other textile electronics were used to make this positive emotion-displaying component, which was easily removable to allow for reusability.
